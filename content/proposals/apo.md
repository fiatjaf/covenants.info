## Introduction

`SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT`, an updated version of `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`, is a proposal for a signature hash
(sighash) where the identifier for the UTXO being spent is not signed, allowing the signature to be
used with any UTXO that is protected by a similar script (i.e. uses the same public keys).

In other words, a transaction presigned with `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` can be signed once and later
"attached" to multiple different outputs, as long as the conditions are met.

The original proposal for `SIGHASH_NOINPUT`, was mentioned in the [original Lightning Network
paper](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) and a more detailed proposal in the
[Eltoo whitepaper](https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf).

## Specification

This proposal has been specified in
[BIP-118](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0118.mediawiki).


## Use Cases

APO was specifically proposed to bring about [Eltoo](/use-cases/eltoo), but can be used to achieve various other use
cases, such as [Statechains](/use-cases/statechains) and [Spacechains](/use-cases/spacechains). It
can also be used to inefficiently emulate a [CTV](/proposals/ctv)-like covenant and all its
use-cases, but the efficiency loss makes these use cases much less compelling than the 3 proposals
above.
